# sturdy-waffle
- To be precise, in this repo I've added all the kinds of personal mini-projects/assignments related to WAD, created and designed by me.  
- I've hosted on GitHub [my most favourite and recent web project](https://atharva01903.github.io/sturdy-waffle/) wherein I actually gained something. 
- Those starting with the basics of front-end WAD viz. HTML, CSS and JS can refer this repo. 
- I'll try to update this repo consistently. 
- If you can make this look simpler to understand do drop a PR. These are some of my genuine efforts to make learning easier for everyone.

I'll be adding django-projects as soon as I finish my first project on Django.

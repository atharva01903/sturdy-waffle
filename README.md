# sturdy-waffle
- This repository contains all the projects related to WAD, I enjoyed developing. 
- I've hosted [my best web project](https://atharva01903.github.io/sturdy-waffle/) through where I actually learned something. 
- Those starting with the basics of front-end WAD viz. HTML,CSS and JS can surely refer this repo. 
- I'll try to update this repo as frequently as possible. 

In future, I'll add django-projects for my reference as well as for those very new to this topic.

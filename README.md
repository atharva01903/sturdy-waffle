# sturdy-waffle
- This repository contains all the kind of mini-projects/assignments related to WAD.  
- I've hosted [my favourite web project](https://atharva01903.github.io/sturdy-waffle/) where I actually learned something. 
- Those starting with the basics of front-end WAD viz. HTML, CSS and JS can surely refer this repo. 
- I'll try to update this repo as frequently as possible. 

I'll be adding django-projects too for those very new to the topic.

# sturdy-waffle
- To be precise, in this repo I've added all the kinds of personal mini-projects/assignments related to WAD, created by me.  
- I've hosted [my favourite web project](https://atharva01903.github.io/sturdy-waffle/) where I actually learned something. 
- Those starting with the basics of front-end WAD viz. HTML, CSS and JS can surely refer this repo. 
- I'll try to update this repo as frequently as possible. 
- If you can make this look simpler to understand do drop a PR. These are one of my efforts to make learning simpler for newbies.

I'll be adding django-projects too for those very new to the topic.
